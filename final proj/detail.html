                    In this project we we used various p5js methods and ideas in order to create various types of
                    interesting brushes for the user to be able to draw and play around with.
                <p>
                    The "üï≥" brush is an eraser that you can use to return anywhere you click and drag over back to the
                    original background.
                </p>
                <p>The simplest brush is the "„Ä∞" brush which is just a normal continuous drawing brush as you would
                    imagine.
                    It's colour is determined by the color picked on the right from a color picker.
                </p>

                <p> The "üü®" brush is a basic discrete, i.e. non connecting, brush that draws squares as you click and
                    drag your mouse.
                    It's colour is determined by the color picked on the left from a color picker.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The "üß∂" brush is my favourite brush. This brush utilizes the begin/endShape p5js methods as well as
                    curveVertex in order to produce the resulting look of twining yarn.
                    It's colour is determined by the color picked on the left from a color picker.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The "‚§¥Ô∏è‚§µÔ∏è" brush is a brush that also uses begin/endShape and curveVertex in order to make a smooth
                    slightly curving line as you draw. The faster you move your mouse as you draw the wider and more
                    open the curve shape gets, looking vaguely yarny.
                    It's colour is determined by the color picked on the right from a color picker.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The "‚ùó" brush use polar offsets to draw rotating, length changing, sticks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "üîÅ" brush also uses polar offsets, but now it also uses curveVertex in order to draw rotating,
                    length changing, curves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the brushes that use curveVertex also use the Math.random() function in order to vary the
                    change in x and y between points being drawn to create more interesting curves.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
