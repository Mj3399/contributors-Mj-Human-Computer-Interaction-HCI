                    <h2>Hi, I'm Michael Allen</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently a senior Computer Science student studying at Northwestern University. I started my
                        time at Northwestern as a Percussion Performance and Math double major. <br><br> However, I eventually
                        ended up getting interested in coding and realised it was something I really enjoyed doing, so I
                        decided to major in Computer Science.
                        <br><br> I've studied various math topics such as: Linear Algebra,
                        Sequences and Series, Calculus,
                        Multivariable Calculus, Computer Science related Proofs, and Real Analysis. 
                        <br><br>In my time at
                        Northwestern I've explored lots of various computer science classes. I've studied Data
                        Structures and Algorithms, AI and Experimental Narrative, Programming Languages, Game Design and
                        Development, Human Computer Interaction, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Assembly Code, and
                        Generative Methods.<br><br>
                        The languages I have the most experience in are C, C++, C#, and Racket. I am familiar with Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS as well.
                        <br><br> You can find most of the things I've coded in my time at Northwestern <a href=https://github.com/Mj3399 id="lin"> here</a>.
